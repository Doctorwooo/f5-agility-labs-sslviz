   automatically provide NTLM credentials

   -  In the address bar of the Firefox browser type in *about:config*

   -  Type in *ntlm* in the search box on the top of the browser. Modify
      the *network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-non-fqdn* and
      *network.automatic-ntlm.trusted-uris* such that the screen looks
