Module 1 - Create a Transparent Forward Proxy SSLO
==================================================

The majority of enterprise forward proxy configurations will involve a single
F5 platform performing the SSL visibility task. The SSL Orchestrator has been
designed with that principle in mind and performs robust security service
chaining of security devices attached to a single appliance. SSL Orchestrator
5.0 now makes configuration of a single-box deployment simple and intuitive.
Please follow the steps below to create a transparent forward proxy SSL
Orchestrator configuration.
