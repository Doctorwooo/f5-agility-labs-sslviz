Lab 1.12: Test the solution
---------------------------

To test the deployed solution, use the following options:

- **Server certificate test**

  Open a browser on the client system and navigate to any remote HTTPS site,
  for example, https://www.google.com. Once the site opens in the browser,
  check the server certificate of the site and verify that it has been issued
  by the local CA configured in SSLO. This confirms that the SSL forward proxy
  functionality enabled by SSL Orchestrator is working correctly.

- **Decrypted traffic analysis on the F5**

  Perform a tcpdump on the F5 system to observe the decrypted clear text
  traffic. This confirms SSL interception by SSLO.

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     tcpdump â€“lnni [interface or VLAN name] -Xs0

  As a function of adding a new service, the UI requires a name for each
  (source and destination) network. SSL Orchestrator will then create separate
  source and destination VLANs for inline security devices, and those VLANs
  will be encapsulated within separate application service paths. For example,
  given an inline layer 2 service named "FireEye" with its "From BIGIP VLAN"
  named "**FireEye_in**", and its "To BIGIP VLAN" named "**FireEye_out**",
  its corresponding BIG-IP VLANs would be accessible via the following syntax:

  **ssloN_** + [network name] + **.app/ssloN_** + [network name]

  Example:

  :red:`ssloN_FireEye_in.app/ssloN_FireEye_in`

  :red:`ssloN_FireEye_in.app/ssloN_FireEye_in`

  A tcpdump on the source side VLAN of this FireEye service would therefore
  look like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

     tcpdump -lnni ssloN_FireEye_in.app/ssloN_FireEye_in -Xs0

  The security service VLANs and their corresponding application services are
  all visible from the BIG-IP UI under Network -> VLANs.

- **Decrypted traffic analysis on the security services**

  Depending on the type of security service, it may easier to log into the
  console shell and run a similar tcpdump capture on the inbound or outbound
  interface, to tail its capture logs, or to log into its management UI and
  capture analytics. A tcpdump capture usually requires root or sudo access.

  .. code-block:: bash

     tcpdump -lnni [interface] -Xs0
