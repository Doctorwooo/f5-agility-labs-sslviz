Lab 7.1: Deleting a topology
----------------------------

Deleting a topology will also delete any relying Interception Rules. The
deletion process performs a complex set of REST-based tasks, therefore only one
topology can be deleted at a time. In the SSLO UI, select a topology and click
the Delete button. Confirm that both the topology and respective interception
rules are removed.
