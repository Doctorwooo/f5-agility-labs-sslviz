Module 7 - Delete an SSLO Configuration
=======================================

One of the benefits of the new SSLO architecture is that configurations can be
edited, deployed and re-deployed without affecting existing traffic flows. For
this capability, the SSLO packaging is now broken into separate independent
components. When deleting a defined topology, most of the attached components
are also deleted. However, some objects, particularly those that can be
consumed by multiple topologies, are not automatically deleted. This module
explores the different methods for deleting SSL Orchestrator objects.
