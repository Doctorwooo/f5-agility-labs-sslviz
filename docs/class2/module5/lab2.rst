Lab 5.2: Review and edit the visual per-request policy
------------------------------------------------------

To view the underlying visual security policy, in the SSLO dashboard view,
navigate to the Security Policies tab and click on a security policy (Per
Request Policies). This will open a new tab with a view of the visual
per-request policy. By default, the security policy is locked and prevents any
changes to the visual per-request policy. To edit the visual policy, first
unlock the policy in the SSLO dashboard, Security Policies tab.

Keep in mind, however, that the rules engine converts rules to visual elements
in one direction only. It cannot convert visual elements back to rules,
therefore once the visual per-request policy has been manipulated, the Guided
Configuration security policies user interface will no longer be available.
