Internal Layered SSL Orchestrator Architecture
================================================

**Objective**

-  Implement an *internal* layered SSL Orchestrator architecture to selectively steer traffic to various SSLO topologies
-  Verify that topology steering functions according to the scenario requirements

.. note::
   This process is documented in the following Github repository:
   `F5 SSL Orchestrator Layered Architecture Configuration <https://github.com/f5devcentral/sslo-script-tools/tree/main/internal-layered-architecture>`_.
   
   This consists of a set of iRules for creating a layered SSL Orchestrator. This method reduces complexity by treating topologies as functions.
