Scenario
--------

Your company recently experienced a network intrusion and an outside consulting firm was brought in to conduct a forensic analysis. One of the findings identified in the report was the lack of a system in your company that provides real-time analysis of network events and long-term storage of analytics and log data.

To address this finding, your company recently implemented a new Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Your manager has asked you to make the necessary changes to send SSL Orchestrator log data to the newly implemented SIEM.

You are tasked with configuring SSL Orchestrator to log connection summary data to your company's SIEM.

Lab Overview
------------

This lab depends on having a working SSL Orchestrator outbound topology. You will be reviewing the logging capabilities of SSL Orchestrator and configuring SSL Orchestrator to send logs off-box to a remote high-speed logging (HSL) server.
