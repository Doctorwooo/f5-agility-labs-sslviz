Module 3 - Transparent authentication using NTLM
================================================

While SSL Orchestrator provides visibility into SSL traffic, the amount
of data that is logged is large. This prevents easy troubleshooting and
a mapping of traffic to originating person can be a difficulty process
especially if there are shared computers in the workplace.

To help with this and provide better manageability, SSL Orchestrator
provides the ability to enable transparent password-less authentication
using industry tested mechanisms like NTLM and Kerberos authentication.

This lab shows the process that is required enable NTLM authentication.
The authentication objects and Access Policy required for the completion
of this lab have already been completed and setup for you.
