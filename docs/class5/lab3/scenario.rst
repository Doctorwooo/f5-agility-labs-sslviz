Scenario:
---------

Your manager lets you know that the company is looking to update its
   Security Policy to log the usernames for all intercepted traffic. You
   are tasked with developing a working Proof of Concept and are asked to
   come up with an action plan to do so with the following restrictions:

   1. This process needs to be transparent to the user that has already
      authenticated to the domain

Lab overview:
-------------

-  This lab will continue work from the previous Lab 2. We will configure
      the SSL Orchestrator to authenticate using NTLM (the security objects
      and the Access Policy) have already been configured to keep this lab
      relevant only to the SSL Orchestrator.
