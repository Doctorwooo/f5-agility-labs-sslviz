===============================================================================================

.. note::

   **Requires UDF Blueprint: "Agility 2022 - SSL Orchestrator 301"**

   **BIG-IP 16.1 / SSL Orchestrator 9.2**

Public cloud introduces some unique infrastructure challenges. Attend this class to learn about recommended practices for deploying the SSL Orchestrator solution into public cloud environments. Cloud deployment generally goes hand-in-hand with automation, so you will also learn how to spin up and onboard new SSL Orchestrator instances using Terraform templates, and then configure SSL Orchestrator Topologies using Ansible playbooks. 

After completing the modules in this lab, you will be understand the following:

- Deployment considerations for public cloud environments
- Automation of SSL Orchestrator infrastructure deployment using Terraform
- Automation of SSL Orchestrator Topology configuration using Ansible


Expected time to complete: **2 hours**
